            Hi! I&apos;m <span>Anusree Anilkumar</span>, a{" "}
            <span>Full-Stack Developer</span> exploring React, Node.js, Next.js,
            and TypeScript, and constantly refining my craft. From building
            <span> 6+ major projects</span> to experimenting with countless
            mini-projects, I believe every line of code teaches something new.
          </p>
          <p>
            Right now, I&apos;m focused on mastering the technical side, but my
            goal is to build apps with better performance, design, and
            scalability. The journey of learning never stopsâ€”there&apos;s always
            room to grow, innovate, and improve.
